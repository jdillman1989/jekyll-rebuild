I’d like to start up this blog to have a more readable record of my work in web development, and my hobbies in illustration. A few reasons for this:

* I want to showcase some PHP and front-end work I have in development.
* It’s an excuse to create a site exactly how I would want.
* I want to be a better writer.

I’ll also be sharing some of my thoughts and preferences about development and illustration, for anyone who happens to read or follow this. Here we go!
