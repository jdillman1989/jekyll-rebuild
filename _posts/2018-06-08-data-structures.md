I’ve had some time to reflect on my work from the past few months, so I’d like to write about a couple of projects and some insights I’ve gained from them.



One of the organizations I work for is going through a major overhaul on its eCommerce platform. We are moving inventory to a new warehouse, changing shipping policies, adding new products, and working towards simplifying our customers’ experience. My role so far has been to rework our SQL databases to conform to our new data structures, rewrite the back-end (PHP) logic associated with those tables, and rework our store website’s custom admin panel. It’s been a lot of work, but I’ve really enjoyed the chance to stretch out my SQL knowledge.



I also started a just-for-fun personal project of developing a web-based computer game. The idea for the game is in the same vein as old text-based adventure games like Zork or Colossal Cave Adventure. I’m working to include multiplayer capabilities as well, similar to games like MUD1. My reason for starting this project is to familiarize myself with a more Javascript-centric stack. I’m exclusively using JSON data structures to store and pass data between the web app and the server, no databases included. The current prototype does have a PHP back-end, but my goal is to transition to Node. It’s been a fun and very unique project so far.



Data structures seem to be a common thread between my work projects lately. My work involves different ways of organizing data, like JSON, SQL, and associative arrays, and how to communicate that data around different programming frameworks. It’s always satisfying when all the different parts of a system fit together nicely and churn out exactly what you expect.
