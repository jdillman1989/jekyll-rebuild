I’m not able to link directly to the web-based admin dashboard for the PHP/MySQL eCommerce platform I helped build, so I’d like to describe it here in more detail.



My job was to overhaul the UX and capabilities of the outdated admin dashboard. When I started, the only site functions available in the dashboard were creating coupon codes, managing images in a featured products section, and viewing orders. The functionality I added included product listing layout options, product pricing management, and Google Shopping integration.



Along with the new functionality, I had to restructure parts of the platform’s database to be compatible with the some of the new dashboard systems. This also involved re-integrating the system with an external product management service.



I really enjoyed working on this project because it took me out of my WordPress/Drupal comfort-zone. Personal projects are the only opportunities I’ve had to code in PHP outside of a larger CMS, so it was a new experience working in vanilla PHP on a larger scale project. It was also great to work with and learn from some veteran developers.
