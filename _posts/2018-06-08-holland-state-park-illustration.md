This is a piece I did as a gift for my family that lives in western Michigan. There are countless beautiful beaches on the Michigan west coast, but Holland State Park has always been special for my family. I practically grew up on this beach, watching the sailboats go by. Besides the subject, I like this piece for the many different textures I was able to capture.
