I recently listened to a really <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/180-panel-on-inline-styles/" target="_blank">interesting panel from ShopTalk</a> about using javascript for styling. Inline styles have been a huge pain-point in web development, so I’m glad to hear several top-tier devs finally giving it some formal validation in the context of javascript. I’ve seen cases of talented devs having their work criticized by less experienced people for inline-styling without any understanding of javascript’s role.

This panel is the first time I’ve heard about relying completely on javascript for styling, and I’m pretty swept-off-my-feet at the idea. I’ve used dynamic styling on the server before using Sass and even PHP, but being able to calculate and run everything client-side sounds really useful.
