I’ve had a few bad experiences with web hosting. When I first registered this URL several years ago, I naively chose the cheapest hosting I could find. I chose iPage, and fortunately it turned out to be a pretty decent service with good support. But when I wanted to start versioning my site with Git and running my own backup processes, I was pretty dismayed to find out that iPage doesn’t allow SSH in any capacity.



I looked into other hosting services that provide more server access, and ended up at HostGator. The transfer process was less than smooth and their SSH access was spotty at best. Their support was unhelpful and unacceptably slow compared to any other hosting service I’ve used. After a month of enduring these things, I cancelled their service.



That was when I first considered setting up my own web hosting server. I wanted to have complete control over my domain, and I also wanted a better understanding of server-side processes. I picked up an old tower at a local computer parts store, installed Ubuntu Server, set up a simple LAMP stack, opened a few router ports, and had the server up and running within an evening.



Running my own web server at home has been a very rewarding experience. I’ve learned a lot about virtual hosts, security, memory usage, databases, bash, and improved my command line skills. Because of my server’s simplicity and my consumer-grade network connection, I’ve had to optimize this site and other projects on this server as much as possible to achieve good performance. I consider this the most valuable aspect of running my own server, and working with these constraints has definitely improved me as a developer.
