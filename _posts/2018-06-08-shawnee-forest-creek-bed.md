My dad, brother and I spent a couple days backpacking through the Shawnee Forest on the River-to-River trail a few years ago. It was a very hot summer, so a lot of the small creeks normally running through the park had completely dried up. We came across one such creek bed around mid day, and stopped for a meal break. I recently did this sketch of the area in graphite.
