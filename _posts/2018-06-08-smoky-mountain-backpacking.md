I took some time off last week to spend a few days backpacking on the Appalachian Trail in the Great Smoky Mountains. It felt amazing to get out of my office chair and just walk and breathe mountain air for 3 days. The trail was much more difficult than I thought it would be, not because of the mountains, but because of how worn down and rocky it was. If you’re not extremely careful with every step, it’s all too easy to roll an ankle or trip. Still, I really enjoyed the physical challenge and the unique landscape.
