This is a recent illustration I did in graphite. I found that my process for this piece was different from most of the work I do because of the amount of negative space it required for the snow effects. I ended up throwing away the first two iterations I started because I hadnâ€™t planned for the whitespace properly. But after a couple of practice sketches, I was happy with how the final piece turned out.
